# Websockets ðŸ”Œ

Websockets represent a persistent connection. Which is different from the standard call and response cycle we use most often.

Normally when we connect to a web server we make a temporary connection that sends a message, notes that the message was received and then closes down the connection.

When you create a connection with a websocket the connection is persistent and allows for data to be passed back and forth without the overhead of opening and closing a connection with each transaction.
